# Sudoku Master

## Overview

Sudoku Master is a Python application offering two classic Sudoku puzzle modes: 4x4 Quest and 9x9 Challenge. It combines a clean and intuitive Tkinter-based graphical user interface with automated puzzle generation and solving capabilities using backtracking algorithms. This project is designed both as an entertaining game and a valuable educational tool to learn programming concepts, recursion, and logical problem-solving.

## Features

- Two playable Sudoku modes: 4x4 for quick puzzles and 9x9 for standard gameplay challenges.
- Adjustable difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, customizing puzzle complexity.
- User interactive controls including hints, undo moves, show solution, and reset functionality.
- Smooth mode switching without restarting the application.
- Modular and well-structured code for easy maintenance and future extensibility.
- Fully realized game logic employing a backtracking approach ensuring unique solvable puzzles.

## Usage

Run the main menu script to start the game interface. Select your preferred mode and difficulty level to begin playing. Number inputs are intuitive, supported by helpful features such as hints and undo. Players can view the full solution or reset puzzles as needed and switch modes seamlessly.
